# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-with-ResNet50

A deep learning project that classifies CIFAR-10 images into 10 categories using a pre-trained ResNet50 model. 
The project employs the ResNet50 deep learning architecture pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tunes it to classify 10 different categories of images, such as airplanes, cars, and animals. The model is enhanced with data augmentation techniques and advanced callbacks like learning rate reduction and early stopping to improve performance and prevent overfitting. The project achieves high accuracy and demonstrates the practical application of transfer learning in computer vision tasks.

Strengths of Your Project :

- Achieved a test accuracy of 86.05% through fine-tuning and data augmentation techniques.
